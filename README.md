This is my rock paper scissors project and is being built to show my understanding of Javascript fundementals like:
-variables
-conditionals
-logical operators
-functions

Build a console based game of rock paper scisors, where the player picks one of the 3 choices then the computer also picks an random choice. Based off the rules of the game a win, lose or a draw is decided; once the user either wins or loses 5 times the game ends with a win screen or a lose screen.  

 My Pseudocode Plan:
1. Get an randomized computerChoice and return its value which will be either: rock, paper or scissors.
2. Make a playRound function that gets the users selection and return the computerSelection as its parameters then returns a string that declares a round winner.  
3. make an game function that keeps score and presents a winner screen to whoever gets 5 points.
